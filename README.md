EDA Capstone Project


The Hotel Booking Analysis project aims to explore and analyze data related to hotel bookings to gain valuable insights and assist hotel management in making informed decisions. The dataset used in this analysis contains information about hotel types, cancellations, customer is regular or not, kind of booking, which moth has highest booking and other relevant features.

Key Objectives:

    Data Exploration: Begin by understanding the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, data types, and basic summary statistics. Identify potential data quality issues and missing values that need to be addressed.

    Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Clean and transform the data to ensure its integrity and reliability for analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and trends in hotel bookings. Investigate factors like seasonal booking trends, peak booking periods, average length of stay, and preferred room types.

    Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on various criteria such as booking behavior, or preferred hotel types. This can help tailor marketing strategies and services to different customer groups.

    Cancellation Analysis: Examine factors contributing to booking cancellations, such as lead time, booking channel, or room type.

    Booking Channel Analysis: Analyze the distribution of bookings through different channels, such as Corporate bookings, Direct, travel agencies, or online platforms. Assess the effectiveness of each channel and identify opportunities for improvement.

    Data Visualization: Utilize various data visualization techniques, including bar charts, line plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots, to present the findings in a visually compelling manner.

    Recommendations: Summarize the key findings and provide actionable recommendations to hotel management. These recommendations should be based on data-driven insights to enhance customer experience, increase customer retention, and improve overall hotel performance.

By conducting a thorough hotel booking analysis, this project aims to provide valuable insights that can drive better decision-making, improve customer satisfaction, and increase the hotel's competitiveness in the hospitality industry. The analysis can also help identify areas for operational efficiency and guide marketing efforts to attract and retain customers effectively.
